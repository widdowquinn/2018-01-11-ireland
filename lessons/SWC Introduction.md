#Â SWC Introduction

**WHY**

* We're here to help you acquire the computing skills to get more research done in less time and with less pain.
* A couple of quotes from a book (on diplomacy! *The Naked Diplomat* by Tom Fletcher) I'm reading:

> "Human progress is note about IQ but how we collaborate and exchange ideas. Innovation thrives on the ability of smart people to create and compete together."
> "All that information is of course worthless unless you know what questions to ask the machine, and how to interpret the responses you get. Those who can curate, interpret, analyse and present it will wield disproportionate influence."

* This workshop is about the computing skills of collaboration and exchange of ideas, and how to use computers to help you curate, interpret, analyse and present your research data.

**HISTORY**

* Founded 1998
* Non-profit organisation, run by and training delivered by volunteers (with paid admin staff)
* Has run hundreds of training workshops, for over 22,000 researchers
    * Today/tomorrow: UW Madison; NUI Galway; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Khartoum
    * Nine more before the end of the month
* Materials written and refined by the SWC community
* All materials open, under Creative Commons licence
* Sister organisations: Data Carpentry, Library Carpentry
    * Organisations soon to merge under a single "Carpentries" heading

**WHAT WE'LL COVER**

* Today: The Shell, and Git - the first, most efficient way to make a computer do exactly what you want, and version control for robust and reproducible research.
* Tomorrow: R - principles of programming, and creating dynamic, reproducible reports. This integrates with today's lessons.

**STICKY NOTES**

* Red/green sticky notes indicate status:
    * Green - OK
    * Red - assistance required
* Place them in a visible location (on the front of our monitor, sticking up)
* At end of each lesson, we'll ask for feedback on that lesson on the sticky notes, and you'll be given new ones.
* Honest feedback **very important for us** - it's how we improve and the next set of learners get better teaching.

**ETHERPAD**

* Shared document for taking notes and workshop chat (like Google Docs)
* You can ask longer/speculative questions here - a helper will try to answer
* Post code snippets/solutions to problems/other cool stuff (links etc.)
* A persistent document for you to refer to afterwards.

**CODE OF CONDUCT**

* "A friendly and respectful place for learning, teaching and contributing. All participants in our events and communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others."

**AFTER THE WORKSHOP** 

* Complete the post-workshop survey
* You may be asked to volunteer for impact study interview in 3 months. Very few people have been volunteering so your participation is very important.
