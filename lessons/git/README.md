# README.md git

This directory contains slides, speaker notes, and a command-line transcript for the `git` lesson.

## Viewing the lesson slides

The lesson slides in `slides_git.md` are readable as Markdown files in any text editor. They are written to use the [`reveal-md`](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md) tool, and if this is installed, they can be viewed with the command:

```
reveal-md --theme=white slides_git.md
```

The speaker notes in `speaker_notes.md` are also written in Markdown and can be read using any text editor.

## Feedback from the previous presentation

The previous presentation was in October 2016. Red stickies are "things that could be better", green are "things that went well":

### Green stickies

* Collaborative work is fun
* Generally very good
* The pace was good with detailed explanation and useful examples
* Well explained and could follow the core ideas easily
* Amazing! Well prepared & clear & excellent to get us doing it ourselves
* Really good! Very easy to follow and informative. No real criticisms.
* Interactive lesson - work on computer and listen
* Easy to follow step-by-step demonstrations & given enough time to try to resolve difficulties
* Worked well as an introduction. Suggest it for anyone who just use git without knowing what's going on
* Great lecturing style. Fun and informative. PS: great lunch!
* Understandable and plenty of support
* Seems useful
* Thank you very much - very beneficial
* Very clear in explanation
* Very well and clearly structured - thank you!
* Good demonstrations
* Enjoyed the branch extension
* All great!

### Red stickies

* A bit more time would be helpful
* Great! Would like to learn about rebase & forking too
* Had no idea what was going on most of the time
* Possibly a bit slow. Some exercises for (branches and?) fork
* Might be helpful to be using the updated version of Git, but only a small thing
* Could have been maybe a little better prepared for different versions of git
* Lots of (unclear) during exercises
* I would expect more plugs close to tables in a programming workshop
* Would have liked to hear about branches in better detail
* Go more slow
* More exercises?
* Can't think of anything
